------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

**CI/CD  
1. I help teams in different forms of the CI/CD , One of my key responsibilites is to mature the process using Automation. 
2. I help the teams in Creating Automated Parameterized Pipleines Continous Integration(CI) / Continous Delivery (CD) / Unit testing using Sonar and Selinum / Security testing using Fortify etc. 
Deployments using Ansible on Linux and Powershell remoting on windows. 
3. i have experience working with Groovy , pipeline syntax , Yaml templates and create scripted/Declarative Pipelines.  
4. I have experience making the CI/CD as automated by creating the webhooks for seemless integration on version control and CI/CD.
5. I have strong experience in Jenkins in configuring several jobs , free style projects, conditional pipelines, building with multiple branches and so on. 
6. I have strong experience also in Azure devops usuing Azure Repos(Git)/ Azure Build and Release pipelines / Azure Test Plans for automated testing/ Azure Artifacts. 
7. In the Build process i used various technologies 
     eg:- .net based applications we used MSBuild and Nuget based .net artifacts. 
          Angular Based Apps we used npm , here we do npm install , npm build-prod
          Java based we used remote maven artifact feeds. , here we do mvn validate, mvn compile , mvn test , mvn install. 
               here we can configure a local or remote maven depending upon the requirement. 
          Python based using Pip. 


--------------------------

Example of a CI Pipeline 
 My CI Pipeline looks like , its a 5 staged pipeline. 
         Stage 1 --> Code Checkout. 
                       - Here we do the Code checkout from the version control, here we can take branch name as input
         Stage 2 --> SCA (Software composition Analysis) & SAST (Static Application Security test). 
                       - In SCA we check for any vulnerable opensources.
                       - In SAST we do check if the code is having any vulnerable methods or classes. 
                       - Once this check passes and atleast 95% compliant, we move to the next step fo creating the artifact 
         Stage 3 --> Code Build / Artifact creation. 
                       - This is the Place we do the Artifact creation i.e war/jar/ear/zip/bin etc. 
                       - In Code packaging, we use maven for Java, MS Build for .net , npm for angular projects. 
         Stage 4 --> Publish Artifact 
                       - Here is the Point where we upload the artifact to artifactor like Jfrog artifactory/ Nesus Repository. 
                       - Here we use curl command in a combinatio nwith Authentication token. 
         Stage 5 --> Docker image creation. 
                       - Here we checkout the Docker file code from the Devops git and from the artifact that is created in previous step. 
                         we create a docker image from the dockerfile by copying the artifact to the image. 
         Stage 6 --> upload image to the Docker Registry 
                       - Once the image is created , you can upload it to the ECR(AWS-Elastic Container Registry)/ACR(Azure Container Registry) 

                       This step completes the build pipeline

------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

** Branching and Merging Strategy 

We use Git flow branching. 
   1. According to this Method, We create 3 different branches in each git repo called Development/QA & Release. 
   2. for us the flow is from Development --> QA --> Release Branches. 
   3. Development branch is used for daily and adhoc builds on Development. 
   4. QA Branch is for Collating all daily builds to Candidate or Production Builds. anything deployed in Prod is first deployed and tested in QA. 
   5. Basically when a developer want to develop any featuere , he will create his own branch which is a copy of dev branch and does the development 
   6. Developer then raises a Merge request with source as his branch and destination as Development branch. 
   7. Once the Code is in Dev Branch a merge request raised to QA and QA Deployment is done and here we do security testing and unit test and feedback.
   8. Once everything is ok , QA --> Release, anathor merge request is raised and final build for prod is generated and deployed. 
   
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   
  
**Docker & Kubernetes:- 

1. My Responsibility in Docker is to work with Various teams and understand the Application and convert the vm based application to a docker image and scale them and deploy them on the kubernetes cluster like EKS(elastic Kubernetes Service)/AKS(Azure Kubernetes cluster)

2. I have knowledge on Creating Pods, Deployments, Replica sets, Pod Autoscaling , Creating Services (NodePort/CLusterIP/Load Balancer) , Kubernetes cronjob, job etc we can do. 
Apart from this i have good knowledge working with yaml as well. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


**Ansible 

1. i have experience working with ANisble , Ansible is used in our case for both configuration Management and Application Automation. 
COnfiguration Management - if we want to change a one simple file like server.xml in tomcat for 100 servers, you need a powerful config mgmt tool to help you 
                           Ansbile can be used in this case. 
Application Automation -  we use this to deploy using jenkins , we use this for Creating Playboooks to install and configure the application and do the builds. 
                           basically we create an inventory file and group the hosts and trigger based on the inventory. 


**GCP 

1. I have been through the phase of Google Cloud Implimentation from the Begining interacting with Google team 
creating the Organization and setting up Policies for the Projects and Folders. 
2. I have involved and configured the GCP with identity Federation OKTA for NOrmal Users and MFA for Admin Accounts.
3. I have involved in the setup of creating the VPC, Shared VPC (Sharing VPC b/w Projects), Security Command Center, Stack Driver logging and etc. 
4. I have interacted with Various teams in Creating the DOcker Images and Deploying the containers on the GKE (Google Kubernetes ENgine)
